I want to build a small LC contest of 1 Hour in which three questions need to be done.

There are 150 questions in Neetcode 150 list. I want to make 50 contests of 3 questions.
The questions for contest need to be selected such that they are balanced for a contest.
Contest should be named, Contest 1 to 50.

UI layout would be like. 
A list of contest, there should be marker whether you have attempted them or not. 
It should have option to reset it, but it should save the last attempt for future 
use (to analyse). User can also delete an attempt. 
So attempt history should be there.
As long as a user opens it, it is marked as attempted.

A 1 hour timer should be there. It should give you notification, half time has elapsed, or 5 minutes are remaining.
When time is done, it should be contest is done. and gives user option to review it or restart or exit contest.

User can select 4 languages (Python, Java, C++, Javascript)

We will just provide the template code.

The ide will be a notepad and not an actual ide with autocompletion or anything. 
This platform is for people to write the code correctly within one go and 
not rely on test cases to cirrect the code.

Tech stack:
1. Vite, React
2. Python, FastAPI
3. Postgres
4. Docker deployable

Whenever an API is added or any functionality is changed,
Run all the integration tests to make sure things work after every change.

UI should be very rich and minimalistic. No fancy shit but very rich looking.
